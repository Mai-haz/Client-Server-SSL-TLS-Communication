# Client-Server SSL/TLS Communication

This project demonstrates a simple SSL/TLS communication between a client and a server using Python. The server accepts connections from clients and ensures secure communication using SSL/TLS.

## Features
- Secure communication using SSL/TLS.
- Simple client-server architecture.
- Error handling for SSL/TLS handshake and communication errors.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/SSL-TLS-Communication.git
    cd SSL-TLS-Communication
    ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.6+ recommended).

3. Install necessary dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Generating SSL/TLS Certificates
1. Generate a self-signed certificate for the server:
    ```sh
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
    ```
    You will need to provide a passphrase and some details for the certificate.

### Running the Server
1. Start the server:
    ```sh
    python server.py
    ```

### Running the Client
1. Start the client:
    ```sh
    python client.py
    ```

## Project Structure
- `client.py`: The client script that connects to the server and sends a message.
- `server.py`: The server script that accepts client connections and handles secure communication.
- `cert.pem`: The self-signed certificate used for SSL/TLS communication.
- `key.pem`: The private key associated with the certificate.
